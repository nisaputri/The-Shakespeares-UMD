This was in this position - 20 Mar 1708/09 but it says Mar 30<sup>th</sup> 1708. If this is right, it belongs a year earlier. Such a dislocation has not occurred elsewhere, and I assume that it is 20 Mch. The speed with which this makes news travel from Genoa, would be accounted for by calendar difference. 22 Jan. 57.
